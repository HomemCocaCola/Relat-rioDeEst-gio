	abstract = {I anatomize a successful open-source project, fetchmail, that was run as a deliberate test of some theories about software engineering suggested by the history of Linux. I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the "cathedral" model, representing most of the commercial world, versus the "bazaar" model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.},

	abstract = {A web content management system (WCM or WCMS) is a software content management system (CMS) specifically for web content. It provides website authoring, collaboration, and administration tools that help users with little knowledge of web programming languages or markup languages create and manage website content. A WCMS provides the foundation for collaboration, providing users the ability to manage documents and output for multiple author editing and participation. Most systems use a content repository or a database to store page content, metadata, and other information assets the system needs. A presentation layer (template engine) displays the content to website visitors based on a set of templates, which are sometimes XSLT files. Most systems use server side caching to improve performance. This works best when the WCMS is not changed often but visits happen frequently. Administration is also typically done through browser-based interfaces, but some systems require the use of a fat client.},

	abstract = {In cryptography, a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, is an electronic document used to prove the validity of a public key. The certificate includes the public key and information about it, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents (called the issuer). If the device examining the certificate trusts the issuer and finds the signature to be a valid signature of that issuer, then it can use the included public key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject. In email encryption, code signing, and e-signature systems, a certificate's subject is typically a person or organization. However, in Transport Layer Security (TLS) a certificate's subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS, sometimes called by its older name Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is notable for being a part of HTTPS, a protocol for securely browsing the web. In a typical public-key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the certificate issuer is a certificate authority (CA), usually a company that charges customers a fee to issue certificates for them. By contrast, in a web of trust scheme, individuals sign each other's keys directly, in a format that performs a similar function to a public key certificate. In case of key compromise, a certificate may need to be revoked. The most common format for public key certificates is defined by X.509. Because X.509 is very general, the format is further constrained by profiles defined for certain use cases, such as Public Key Infrastructure (X.509) as defined in RFC 5280.},

	abstract = {HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should automatically interact with it using only HTTPS connections, which provide Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL), unlike the insecure HTTP used alone. HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797. The HSTS Policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an HTTP response header field named Strict-Transport-Security. HSTS Policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion. Websites using HSTS often do not accept clear text HTTP, either by rejecting connections over HTTP or systematically redirecting users to HTTPS (though this is not required by the specification). The consequence of this is that a user-agent not capable of doing TLS will not be able to connect to the site. The protection only applies after a user has visited the site at least once, relying on the principle of "trust on first use". The way this protection works is that when a user entering or selecting an HTTP (not HTTPS) URL to the site, the client, such as a Web browser, will automatically upgrade to HTTPS without making an HTTP request, thereby preventing any HTTP man-in-the-middle attack from occurring.},

	abstract = {Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) has grown substantially over the past decades, becoming an essential part of the modern world. FOSS refers to software that preserves the user’s freedom to read the program’s source code, make modifications and redistribute it. Since the source code is open and accessible to everyone, the user is not only permitted, but also encouraged to make modifications to the software to fill specific needs. Corporations utilize that capability to get access to specifically tailored software for their needs, while proprietary software fails to meet that promise due to providing a standardized package of the software, adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. Therefore, FOSS allows for a more efficient fulfillment of software needs. Additionally, FOSS can play an important role in the protection of human rights in the digital realm, particularly in the case of the right to privacy. Because of its transparent nature, FOSS is more respectful towards the user’s privacy, compared to proprietary software, since the latter restricts the user from knowing the program’s under the hood functionality. With closed source software, arises a problem of asymmetric information between the software company and the consumer. FOSS offers a solution to this information asymmetry, by allowing users to obtain information about the inner workings of the program they rely upon. Through FOSS, the imbalance of power between the developer and the user disintegrates.},

	abstract = {If you’re watching this video, you’re probably wondering — What is a headless CMS?

A headless CMS is a content management system that separates the presentation layer (where content is presented) from the backend (where content is managed).

A headless CMS allows you to manage content in one place and be able to deploy that content on any digital channel you choose. Separating the frontend from the backend unlocks your content, making it easier for marketers to manage content independently, and for developers to build faster, automate changes, and manage digital at scale. In a traditional CMS, content is tangled up with code and locked in silos, making reusing content — and creating modern digital experiences — next to impossible.

Responsive web design provides a website with a flexibility to adapt to any of these devices, i.e. their resolutions. The paper presents statistics and predictions of market trends regarding the devices and user experiences in web browsing and m-commerce.
